# dynamo-protocols

Request/response types for OpenAI- and Anthropic-compatible inference servers. Built on [`async-openai`](https://crates.io/crates/async-openai) v0.34, with selective overrides where inference engines need behaviors upstream doesn't support.

## What's included

- **Chat Completions** — multimodal content, reasoning content (DeepSeek-R1 / QwQ), continuous usage stats, tool-calling.
- **Batch API** — re-exported from upstream.
- **Files API** — re-exported from upstream.
- **Responses API** — input chain owned (relaxed for Codex / Agents SDK); output chain re-exported from upstream.
- **Completions** — re-exported.
- **Anthropic Messages** — fully owned (no upstream equivalent).
- **Embeddings**, **Images** — re-exported.

## Locally-defined extensions

A few fields extend the upstream `async-openai` schema:

- `reasoning_content` on assistant messages
- `mm_processor_kwargs` on chat-completion requests (vLLM multimodal)
- `continuous_usage_stats` on chat stream options
- `FunctionCall.arguments` accepts both string and object forms
